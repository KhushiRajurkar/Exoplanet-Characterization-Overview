# exoplanet-foundation-demo
This notebook provides a simplified demonstration of the proposed ML pipeline for foundational exoplanet modeling. It currently performs classification on simulated planetary features and will be adapted to handle multimodal inputs such as spectral data, atmospheric simulations, and telescope images.
